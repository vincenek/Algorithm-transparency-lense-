      <h2>FlatChain Overview</h2>
      <p>FlatChain is not a cryptocurrency—it’s a blockchain-based protocol that validates fiat-based transactions using AI instead of miners. This means cheaper, faster, and more eco-friendly financial records. It forms the backbone of our financial governance platform and lays the groundwork for a borderless, automated tax collection system powered by big data and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h2>Execution Plan</h2>
      <p>Our plan rolls out in layered phases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Build the static front-end (this website), develop the Figma UI/UX, and publish the vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Integrate the Normal and Ghost Wallets with a functional test backend and manual AI scripting.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Launch FlatChain alpha, begin compliance modeling, and prototype the tax system structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Establish partnerships with banks and micro-nations for testing the AI tax framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Scale using Quantum AI processing power and transition to a fully autonomous global tax network.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Future Vision</h2>
      <p>The ultimate goal is a Quantum-Magnetic Civilization: one no longer reliant on electricity as we know it, but powered by quantum fields, with FlatChain replacing national tax collection and NOvA-X serving as its financial brain. This is a gift to the world—a system of power, fairness, and freedom.</p>
